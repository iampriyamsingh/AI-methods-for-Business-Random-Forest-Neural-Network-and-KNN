# AI Methods for Business - Final Assignment (2023/24)

## Overview

This repository contains the final assignment for the "AI Methods for Business" course (2023/24). The assignment involves applying various machine learning models to analyze two datasets: **used car auction prices** and **bank transactions**. The goal is to answer formulated business questions through model development, evaluation, and interpretation.

## Datasets

1. **Used Car Auction Prices Dataset**  
   - **Objective**: To determine factors influencing car resale prices.
   - **Models Used**: 
     - Random Forest
     - Neural Network
   - **Tasks Performed**:
     - Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)
     - Data Cleaning and Feature Engineering
     - Model Fitting with Hyperparameter Tuning
     - Model Evaluation and Comparison
     - Explainability Analysis

2. **Bank Transactions Dataset**  
   - **Objective**: To identify patterns in customer transactions.
   - **Models Used**:
     - K-Means Clustering
   - **Tasks Performed**:
     - Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)
     - Data Cleaning and Feature Engineering
     - Dimensionality Reduction using PCA
     - Clustering and Cluster Interpretation

## Deliverables

- **Python Code**: Jupyter notebooks containing all the code for data processing, model training, evaluation, and visualization.
- **Video Presentation**: A 10-minute video explaining the project, with each team member contributing.
- **Presentation Slides**: PowerPoint slides used in the video presentation.

## Reflection

A reflection on the teamwork process and the challenges encountered during the project is included in the documentation.
